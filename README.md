Implementing a digital Library of Babel

This project is inspired by a similair project by Jonathan Basile (https://libraryofbabel.info), which was based on 
a short story called The Library of Babel by Jorge Luis Borges.

My goal is to build upon Jonathan's idea and build a complete library. Instead of every unique page, this 
library will contain every possible book. The format of the books remains mostly the same as the original story, with 
each book containing 410 pages with 40 lines per page and 80 characters per line. However, I am deviating from Borges' 
story by expanding the character set. The books in this library will be made up of combinations of 256 possible characters, 
which gives a total of 256<sup>1,312,000</sup> books.
